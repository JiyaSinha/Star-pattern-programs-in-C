# Star-pattern-programs-in-C
In all these programs we have been using the logic of loops to complete our tasks.
Most of the for loops used here are nested to perform step by step computation.
The first for loop is used to change the line and the further nested loops are used for printing star patterns.
Such programs completely makes our concepts about program control to be very easy and understandable.
